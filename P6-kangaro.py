Algorithm Steps:

- Promote user to input the initial positions and jump distances for two kangaroos (k1p, k1v, k2p, k2v).

- Initialize a flag as False to track if the kangaroos meet.

- Repeat up to 500 times:

    Add the jump distance to each kangarooâ€™s position.

    Check if both kangaroos are at the same position:

        If yes, set the flag to True and exit the loop.

- After the loop, check the flag:

    If it's True, print "Yes, kangaroos meet" and show the position.

    Otherwise, print "No", the kangaroos never meet.
